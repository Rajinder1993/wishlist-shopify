  Shopify Wishlist
  Usage:
    - Create a new page in the Shopify admin
      - Admin > Online store > Pages > Add page
    - Set the new page's template to: 'page.wishlist' (this template)
    - Do NOT remove the `grid-wishlist` attribute
  
  Notes:
  - The grid will be populated with product cards using Javascript
  - Any content inside of the `[grid-wishlist]` element will be completely replaced by the product cards
  
  Tip:
  - Place a loading element inside the `[grid-wishlist]` element and it will automatically be removed once the product cards have loaded
  - Add any liquid code before/after the grid element
